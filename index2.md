# Setup

To illustrate web scraping concepts, this workshop will make use of absolutely free and convenient online notebooks. In order to participate in the workshop, please install one of the following:

1. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) 
2. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) 

## A note about environment setup

For beginners who are interested in exploring scripts without the overhead of environment setup, Project Jupyter and Google Colab are great resources. They are hosted on computational environments that require minimal environment setup.

You can see Google Colab in action and try some code here: [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com). Login with a Google account, then select "_File_ -> _New notebook_" to access a basic coding environment.

No prior knowledge on web scraping is required for this workshop, but having some basic knowledge on python will be an added advantage. This is an introductory workshop where we will revisit some core python concepts and also use supplemental techniques around the actual act of scraping.
