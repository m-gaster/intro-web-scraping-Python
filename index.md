Web scraping is a powerful tool which unlocks doors to new data. This workshop will introduce attendees to some tools and techniques for getting data from web pages using Python, with an emphasis on tools that do not require knowledge of html. We will go through several hands-on examples together, where attendees will gain experience identifying sites with scrapable data, retrieving the data, cleaning it, understanding it, and saving it. 

## Learning objectives

At the end of this workshop, you will:
1. Have the building blocks for using web scraping in your research.
2. Know what kind of tool to use for a given scraping problem.
3. Know when it is legal and ethical to scrape information from a website.
